#example 1.
#Create a function named combo() that takes two iterables and returns a list of tuples. Each tuple should hold the first item in each list, 
#then the second set, then the third, and so on. Assume the iterables will be the same length.

# combo([1, 2, 3], 'abc')
# Output:
# [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
# If you use .append(), you'll want to pass it a tuple of new values.


def combo(iter1, iter2):
    list_of_tuples = []
    
    for index2, value in enumerate(iter2):
        list_of_tuples.append(  (iter1[index2], value)  )
    return list_of_tuples
